# New Platypus OS Drafts
New OS drafts, I stopped the old one :(
## What this is for
I'm using Linux drivers right now for keyboard support and working on adding needed libraries, but really, there's only output functions, but I want it to be for:
1. Programming
2. Pentesting
3. Playing video games

Seems like an odd combination, but that's what I like to do: program, pentest, and play video games.

## Please test on QEMU!
